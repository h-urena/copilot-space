# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation! This README serves as an overview and entry point to our comprehensive project management resources, designed to guide teams through our structured approach to delivering high-quality products and services.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme employs a structured, iterative project management approach tailored for cross-functional teams delivering product features, services, and integrations. At its core, the process emphasizes customer-first priorities, clear ownership with designated Project Managers (PMs) and Product Managers (PdMs), data-informed decision-making, and psychological safety to foster feedback and learning. Key personas include PMs who coordinate delivery and risk management, PdMs who define outcomes and prioritize backlogs, developers responsible for implementation and testing, QA testers for quality validation, and stakeholders for inputs and approvals. This role clarity ensures alignment and accountability across projects, with artifacts like project charters, roadmaps, and risk registers serving as foundational tools.

The project lifecycle follows a five-stage model: initiation for validating needs and aligning stakeholders, planning to break work into increments with defined acceptance criteria, execution via daily standups and project boards (e.g., GitHub Projects with columns for Backlog to Done), release through automated pipelines and smoke tests, and closure with retrospectives. Workflows prioritize small pull requests with CI testing, regular demos, and blocker escalation from team-level triage to sponsor involvement. Quality assurance is integral, incorporating unit and integration tests, security scans, manual QA for features, and metrics tracking for velocity and success indicators.

Communication strategies maintain transparency and rhythm, with weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly delivery team standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations. Templates for weekly status reports, incident communications, and release notes ensure consistent messaging. Risk management involves maintaining a register for ongoing assessment and mitigation, while continuous improvement thrives through timeboxed retrospectives that yield actionable items reviewed in weekly syncs, promoting a culture of iterative enhancements and blameless learning.
